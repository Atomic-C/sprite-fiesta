# sprite-fiesta
Sprites are two-dimensional images or animations overlaid into a scene. They are the non-static elements within a 2D game, moving independently of the background. Often used to represent player-controlled characters, props, enemy units, etc., sprites can be composed of multiple tiles or smaller sprites. This repo is my first adventure with this concept.


Important .gitignore note to self:

Follow these steps to avoid Unity noise files:

Also, place .gitignore, git repo, inside your project directory, instead of one directory above.

.gitignore does not IGNORE files unless they're in the SAME DIRECTORY.

Lesson learned afer nuking the repo a couple of times.
