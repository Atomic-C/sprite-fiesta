Sprites are two-dimensional images or animations overlaid into a scene. They are the non-static elements within a 2D game, moving independently of the background. Often used to represent player-controlled characters, props, enemy units, etc., sprites can be composed of multiple tiles or smaller sprites. This repo is my first adventure with this concept.
